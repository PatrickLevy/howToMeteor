          I would like to thank all the contributors of the websites listed under "Next Steps" as well as the contributors at Stack Overflow for providing such a valuable resource to all programmers and students of computer science.  These sites have provided the vast majority of my learning of Meteor so far.  I would also like to thank TJ Fletcher for his technical feedback on my first Meteor Proejcts.
